# PortingOStoBlockchain
Porting Classical x86, x64 Operating Systems to the Blockchain

 The ability to completely ‘port’ an operating system to the Blockchain/Hyperledger
i.e., Win9x → Blockchain
15
WinXP, 7, 8.1, 10/11 → Blockchain
WinServ 2003+ → Blockchain
Linux, Ubuntu, Unix, macOS (?)
- What about the ability to incorporate past distros, releases as domain names?
i.e., .winxp, .windows7, .windows2000
and then run them as cmdlets?
- Windows PowerShell ran from within a Blockchain-like ‘docker,
’ responding to PowerShell-like command/requests from
w/in a Python console, ran from within a Node Operator-like environment…
- Bitcoin PowerShell
- Blockchain PowerShell
- A Blockchain-hosted OS, ran within a browser, via .windows domain name?
BlockchainOS
- BlockchainOS – kind of like ChromOS (?)

.os as a domain name extension?
-
.operatingsystem
- ipfs://$bitcoin
- Inner-blockchain transfers perhaps just like inner-operating-system Windows command, only for Bitcoin/crypto
environment, its tokenized transfer(s)?
i.e., RUN command: ipfs://$Bamount
destination
hash

- Layers of Blockchain-like environments ran as, each layer, as a different/past distribution of a certain OS, or a
combination of 4 or 5 or 6 or 7…
Layer 1: XP
Layer 2: 7
Layer 3: 8.1
Layer 4: 10
Layer 5: 11…

Layer 1: 2003
Layer 2: 2008 (R1/2)
Layer 3: 2012
Layer 4: 2016
Layer5: 2019…
